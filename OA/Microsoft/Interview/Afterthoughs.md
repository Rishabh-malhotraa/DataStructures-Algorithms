Interview with Microsoft.

## First Interview

- The first interview was the hardest, some obscure, prefix-trie questions, a lot of boilerplate to write. It gave me my first Google phone screen vibes. I mean, I was trying to solve the problem in real time. I got some hints from my interviewer about structuring my Trie as words and not character.
- My interviewer midway asked me to chill out on writing boilerplate for Trie and write the primary function, lol.
- I was able to complete the function, it had some bugs, but I was satisfied with me being able to solve the problem.
- Still, after the interview, I was uncertain about the outcome. I wouldn't be surprised either way, as I could have done a bit better and come to the solution a bit faster.

## Second Interview

- In this interview, my internet connection went bonkers. Literally, it was really, really bad. I eventually called the interviewer on the phone, which was a sage decision.
- The first question was simple, and I had solved this question in the past, but I did not remember exactly how to do it, so I spent some time and was able to come to the solution.
- The second question of the interview is where I really shined. It was more like a brain teaser, I was unable to find the answer. Still, with some hints, I was able to get to the solution, which made me really satisfied, also gave the impression that I am super coachable. :3

## Third Interview

- I got the call for the following interview 30 minutes after my second from my recruiter.
- This was my best interview of the lot. All my interviews got progressively better, lol.
- My interview gave me a very abstract problem statement, but within 30 seconds, I was able to make out that the question is  isomorphic to the famous rotten oranges question and could be solved with BFS
- I am super good at writing high-quality BFS code.
- My code quality stood out to my interviewer.
- The next question was about merging sets, and it was more of a discussion. That went well, too, few hiccups, but that happens; how you deal with those hiccups is what's more important.
- The interview ended on an excellent note.


**Obviously, you can never be certain about the outcome, but the interview well really well. If someone yesterday would tell me that this is how your interview would go, I'll take this outcome any day of the week, now its all left to fate, if it's meant to be it will happen.**

**Hoping for the best 🤞😀**
